# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

The goal of this repository is to implement various Machine Learning algorithms using only plain Python and Numpy. The following algorithms will be implemmented:

- Logistic Regression: check
- Feedforward Neural Network: check
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Trees
- KNN
- K-Means
- SVM
- Naive-Bayes
